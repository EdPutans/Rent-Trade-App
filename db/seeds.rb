# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first


# Listing.create(title: "help", description: "testing", "2001,2,3", landlord_name: "bob", landlord_info: "big man", landlord_phone: 1242, landlord_email: "dsada@fdsfs.com", address)
